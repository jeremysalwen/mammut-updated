  MainAppWindow.cpp :

  This file defines the configuration of the main application window, which
  is the class MainAppWindow.

  The JUCE class 'DocumentWindow' is the base for this class, so examine the
  documentation for any functions that you may wish to use, or any other
  configuration options you may wish to change.

  The 'window' is the main bit that the program sits within. That means 'the
  bit with the title bar and the overall size/shape of the program, but without
  the actual program on it yet'. Your program lives in the 'MainComponent' class,
  and is added to this window as the 'content component'.

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Please feel free to do whatever you like with this code, bearing in mind that
  it's not guaranteed to be bug-free!
