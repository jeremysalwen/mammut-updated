  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ApplicationStartup.cpp :

  This file describes how the application will be brought to life within the
  operating system. The basic order of things is...

  [OS] - creates the 'AppClass', which understands JUCE...
         ... the [AppClass] creates the MainAppWindow and puts it on the screen...
		     ... the [MainAppWindow] is a visible base for the program, and it
			     creates the program's MainComponent on itself...
				 ... the [MainComponent] then 'does' the 'program stuff'

  There's probably not much need for you to want to edit this file if you're
  only writing simple applications.

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Please feel free to do whatever you like with this code, bearing in mind that
  it's not guaranteed to be bug-free!

       This is because the application object gets created before Juce has been properly
       initialised, so any embedded objects would also get constructed too soon.
